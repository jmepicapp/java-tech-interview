# java-tech-interview

The Asaitec fruit shop exercise has been implemented using **Spring** and **SpringBoot** and some modules like **JPA** and **Lombok** following **MVC** pattern.

It has been developed taking into account the software possibility to scale by allowing persistence in a database if required. It also allow to be splited into diferent modules or microservices that could be run individualy in a container depending on business needs (for example: fruit storage).

Unfortunately, it couldn't be finished either tested but during the development process I realized in some improvements. To track them, I created issues in this repository:
- [ ] https://github.com/jmepicapp/java-tech-interview/issues/1
- [ ] https://github.com/jmepicapp/java-tech-interview/issues/2

The exercise is implemented in [develop branch](https://github.com/jmepicapp/java-tech-interview/tree/develop).

⚠️ As informed to Mercedes I'd like to implement those improvents and finish the exercise in a different branch than develop.
